The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on a React Native/Expo application with an Express.js backend, Firebase, and Stripe integration. Initially, the AI misidentified the project's backend framework, but quickly corrected itself after reviewing the codebase. A significant portion of the work involved setting up the development environment, fixing supervisor configurations, and managing environment variables for both backend and frontend.

A key challenge was synchronizing the local project () with the user's original GitHub repository () and debugging the Stripe payment flow. The AI systematically addressed various issues, from missing file components to incorrect API endpoint calls and environment variable loading. The transition from Firebase Dev to Prod environment was also handled. The last few interactions focused on ensuring all features, including contact and statistics pages, were mirrored from the original project. The AI's approach was iterative, fixing one bug at a time and confirming with the user.

<product_requirements>
The user provided a React Native/Expo application, A La Case Nout Gramoun, which is a platform connecting home caregivers with clients. The application features a React Native frontend, an Express.js backend, Firebase (Firestore, Auth), and Stripe for payments.
**Key functionalities implemented so far:**
*   **Frontend:** React Native with Expo Router, elegant animations on the landing page, authentication system (signup/login), caregiver search with filters, detailed caregiver profiles with reviews, real-time messaging, and payment flows (, ).
*   **Backend:** Express.js with a complete REST API for authentication (), services (), Stripe integrations, and messaging.
*   **Firebase Functions:** Cloud functions in TypeScript.
*   **Stripe Integration:** Full payment flow (deposit + final balance) with LIVE keys and explicit payment methods configured.
*   **Firebase Configuration:** Both Development () and Production () Firebase projects have been configured and connected, with the application now targeting the Production environment.
*   **Missing Features Added:** The Contact page (app/contact.tsx and app/(tabs)/contact.tsx) and several UI components (SafeScreen, AvisDisplay, PricingDisplay, ProfileCardSkeleton, ThemedText, ThemedView) were identified as missing from the working  project (derived from AI's earlier fixes) and subsequently added to match the original  GitHub repository.
*   **Deployment:** The application can be built for Android using EAS () and tested via Expo Go tunnel (env: load .env
env: export EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL EXPO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_COMMISSION_RATE EXPO_PUBLIC_MIN_PAYMENT_AMOUNT
Starting project at /app
Starting Metro Bundler).
The immediate goal was to fix bugs and ensure the  project is an identical, bug-free clone of .

<code_architecture>
The application has a monorepo-like structure, with a root  directory containing the main React Native/Expo project and possibly other services (though the trajectory mainly focused on the React Native part).



**Key files and modifications:**

*   **/app/.env:**
    *   **Purpose:** Stores frontend environment variables including , , .
    *   **Changes:** Updated with  URL for backend access and Stripe LIVE public key; changed  to .

    *   **Changes:** Created this file, implementing the UI and logic for email and phone actions, including robust error handling and logging.
*   **/app/app/(tabs)/contact.tsx:**
    *   **Purpose:** Entry point for the contact tab in the navigation.
    *   **Changes:** Created this file, acting as a re-export of .
*   **/app/components/ProfileCardSkeleton.tsx:**
    *   **Purpose:** Placeholder component for loading states.
    *   **Changes:** Corrected its export to be a default export to resolve import issues in .
*   **/app/src/config/stripe.ts:**
    *   **Purpose:** Frontend configuration for Stripe endpoints.
    *   **Changes:** Updated to point to the  backend URL instead of Firebase Functions URL for all Stripe-related API calls.
*   **/app/src/stripe/httpPaymentService.ts:**
    *   **Purpose:** New service to handle HTTP requests to the Express.js backend for payments.
    *   **Changes:** Created this file to encapsulate the HTTP payment logic, replacing direct Firebase Functions calls.
*   **/app/src/stripe/paymentService.ts:**
    *   **Purpose:** Core payment orchestration logic, using Stripe SDK.
    *   **Changes:** Modified to use  instead of ; adjusted deposit (20%) and final payment (80%) calculations; added detailed logging; corrected the function name from  to  to match the actual function definition.

- Ensure the Statistiques page, which is integrated into the admin page in the original project, is fully present and functional in .
- Troubleshoot the Stripe account restriction message, which prevents LIVE payments despite having LIVE keys. This involves user action on the Stripe dashboard.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the Probl√®me lors du paiement error. This error, initially stemming from incorrect backend URL usage and Stripe metadata formatting, evolved into an issue with the Stripe SDK's  function not being recognized.

The AI diagnosed that the  file incorrectly used  when the actual function was named . After correcting this typo in  (from  to ), the Stripe Payment Sheet successfully opened on the user's mobile device.

The user then reported a Stripe account not activated message appearing within the Stripe Payment Sheet, despite having provided LIVE keys. The AI explained this is a common security restriction for new Stripe accounts or temporary domains like ngrok. The user confirmed that the client would address the Stripe account restrictions.

The AI then started addressing missing features from the original GitHub project, specifically the Contact page (which was added) and the Statistiques page. The latest action was to confirm that the Statistiques are integrated within an admin page in the original project, indicating the AI is now verifying the completeness of this feature in the  project.
